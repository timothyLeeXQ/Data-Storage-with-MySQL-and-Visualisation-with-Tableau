# Assignment 4: Batch Model Processing and Data Visualisation with Tableau

## Objectives
* Learn to write data to a MySQL server hosted on Amazon RDS
* Learn to access a MySQL server using Tableau and generate relevant
visualisations

**Notes:**
1. [`src/visualisations`](src/visualisations) contains tableau files for the
visualisations
2. Assignment 4 code is added to the back of a cloned Assignment 3 document, named
[`assignment_4.ipynb`](src/assignment_4.ipynb) and [`assignment_4.py`](src/assignment_4.py)
3. Interpretation of graphs is included in
<<<<<<< HEAD
[`reports/assn_4_output.md`](assn_4_output.md)
4. The outcome variable was incorrectly labelled and analysed as "pit stop lap time" before. This critical error has just been discovered and immediately amended in all documents and on the SQL server.
  - I realise this is a big mistake and has only been amended after the deadline. I understand if grading penalties are applied.
  - Only changes to tableau workbook are axis names and line colours
